Citation context shows how papers reference each other. Research feeds surface relevant new papers. Completely free, which is remarkable. Coverage skews toward CS and biomedical—humanities and social sciences less comprehensive. Should be every researcher's first stop.",

Dramatically speeds up the early stages of research. The extraction isn't perfect—always verify against the source—but it's a massive time saver. Works best for empirical research with clear findings; less useful for theoretical or qualitative work. The free tier is quite generous.",
