GPT-5 is fast and multimodal. Personally, I prefer ChatGPT to competitors for the way it feels when talking to it.\n\nFor a long time I have been using it with a Plus subscription but I eventually cancelled. Even with the free tier I find it very useful. The added benefits of the Plus subscription were not enough to keep me from switching to the free tier.",

Copilot Chat is already good and with newer models being added on a rolling basis, it’s only getting better.

Downsides: occasional confident-but-wrong suggestions. Essential for professional developers, but verify its output.",
