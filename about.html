            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Simon Weigold began his academic journey at the Hanover University of Music, Drama and Media, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in Media Management. During his undergraduate years, he was recognized for his academic excellence with scholarships from the Deutschlandstipendium and the CULT-Foundation. While still pursuing his bachelor's degree, Simon Weigold gained invaluable experience through internships at a market-leading market research company and later as a Junior Data Scientist at a market research and consulting firm. These experiences laid the foundation for Simon Weigold's interest in computational methods for social sciences.</p>
            <p>Currently enrolled in a Master's degree program in Computational Social Sciences at the University of Lucerne, Simon is contributing to the SNF project Choice of Law Dataverse, led by Prof. Dr. Daniel Girsberger and Agatha Brand√£o de Oliveira.</p>
