            <h2>&#129501; Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>Originally from a small town in southern Germany, my journey through Frankfurt and Hanover has led me back south to the heart of Switzerland. Each new location has fueled my innate curiosity and love for exploration, enriching my interactions and broadening my perspectives. My initial interest in media's role within society quickly evolved into a fascination with the dynamic <b>interplay between technology and human behavior</b>‚Äîa perfect intersection of my personal interests and professional goals. Now, with a <b>solid foundation in the humanities</b> and <b>robust technical skills</b>, I am expanding my knowledge in technology and programming, continually excited by the prospect of discovering and mastering new concepts.</p>
            <p>Away from the computer screen, I unwind by running, recently taking on the challenge of half marathons. These runs help clear my mind, complementing my quieter enjoyment of brilliantly written books (currently hyping the Game of Thrones books).</p>
